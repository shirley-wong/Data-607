## Week 7 Assignment Description

Pick three of your favorite books on one of your favorite subjects. At least one of the books should have more than one author. For each book, include the title, authors, and two or three other attributes that you find interesting.

Take the information that you’ve selected about these three books, and separately create three files which store the book’s information in HTML (using an html table), XML, and JSON formats (e.g. “books.html”, “books.xml”, and “books.json”). To help you better understand the different file structures, I’d prefer that you create each of these files “by hand” unless you’re already very comfortable with the file formats.

Write R code, using your packages of choice, to load the information from each of the three sources into separate R data frames. Are the three data frames identical?

Your deliverable is the three source files and the R code. If you can, package your assignment solution up into an .Rmd file and publish to rpubs.com. [This will also require finding a way to make your three text files accessible from the web].

## Convert HTML to R Dataframe

- The source file is as of below:

```{r HTML Source File}
url <- getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shirley-wong/Data-607/master/Three_Books.htm')
HTML_data <- htmlParse(url)
HTML_data
```


- Load HTML data into R as dataframe using `rvest` Package:

```{r HTML}
HTML_df <- url %>%
  read_html(encoding = 'UTF-8') %>%        # read url link for HTML data into R as a list
  html_table(header = NA, trim = TRUE) %>% # convert the file to a list of dataframes
  .[[1]]                                   # Get the first element 

kable(HTML_df)
str(HTML_df)
```

## Convert XML to R Dataframe

- The source file of is as below:

```{r XML Source File}
url <- getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shirley-wong/Data-607/master/Three_Books.xml')
XML_data <- xmlParse(url)
XML_data
```

- Load XML data into R as dataframe using `XML` Package:

```{r XML}
XML_df <- url %>%
  xmlParse() %>%                                #read url link for XML data into R as a list
  xmlRoot() %>%                                 #get the root node of XML data
  xmlToDataFrame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%  #convert the XML data to dataframe
  mutate(Year=as.integer(Year))
kable(XML_df)
str(XML_df)
```

## Convert JSON to R Dataframe

- The source file of is as below:

!['JSON Source File'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shirley-wong/Data-607/master/JSON%20Source%20File.PNG)


- Load XML data into R as dataframe using `jsonlite` Package:

```{r json}
url <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shirley-wong/Data-607/master/Three_Books.json")
JSON_df <- url %>%
  fromJSON() %>%    #read JSON file
  .[[1]] %>%  #get the first element from the list which is the dataframe we are looking for
  mutate(Authors = unlist(lapply(Authors, function(x) str_c(x, collapse = ', ')))) #get the values in the lists of Authors column and fit them into dataframe

kable(JSON_df)
str(JSON_df)

```


## Comparison

**1. Between HTML and XML**

The two dataframes converted from HTML file and XML file are not exactly the same. The original data in element \<table\> in HTML file are completely and accurately parsed into R dataframe, however the original data in element \<Authors\> are parsed and concated without delimiters.
```{r HTML VS XML}
all.equal(HTML_df,XML_df)
rbind(HTML_df$Authors, XML_df$Authors)
```

**2. Between HTML and JSON**

The two dataframes are identical.

```{r HTML VS JSON}
all.equal(HTML_df,JSON_df)
```

**3. Between XML and JSON**

The two dataframe converted from XML file and JSON file are not exactly the same. The original data in element \<Authors\> are parsed and concated without delimiters, however the original data in element "Authors" are parsed and concated with ',' as delimiters.

```{r XML VS JSON}
all.equal(XML_df,JSON_df)
rbind(XML_df$Authors, JSON_df$Authors)
```
